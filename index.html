    <h2>speaking in parts — wa uba</h2>
    <p>
        <span class="tlt">{&#164 |kawaba} {ka|kind, variety} {wa|say, speak} {ba|part, piece}</span> is a <b>minimalist</b> philosophical
        constructed language that attempts to express the entirety of the human experience through just 120 single syllable roots. with a
        simple <b>phonology</b>, limited <b>lexicon</b>, and <b>oligosynthetic grammar</b>, the language is designed to be as simple,
        neutral, and expressive as possible. the language's roots are made up of a reduced list of 50 <b>semantic primes</b>, a set of
        fundemental linguistic concepts that cannot be defined more simply, in addition to 50 common <b>semantic molecules</b>, more
        complex yet highly productive concepts that can be defined using semantic primes alone, as well as 20 roots used for grammatical
        purposes.
