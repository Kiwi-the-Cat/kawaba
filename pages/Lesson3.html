        <h2>Lesson 3 - Compound Words</h2>
        <h3>Creating basic compounds</h3>
        <p>
            To convey meaning beyond the base vocabulary, kawaba uses 
            compound words. Compounds are head initial, meaning they derive their base meaning from the first word in the compound.
        </p>
        <p>To make a compound, simply chain roots together! For example, <span class="tlt">{pun|"creature"}</span> + <span class="tlt">{pin|"sky"}</span> makes <span class="tlt">{punpin|"sky creature"}</span>, a "sky creature" that may be a bird, an angel, a flying insect, or anything else that could be described as a "sky creature". Remember that in kawaba, any word can be any word class - compound words can be nouns, verbs, adjectives, or adverbs!</p>
        
        <p>Now, see if you can figure out what these compounds might mean: </p>
        <p><span class="tlt">{★ | "computer" (thinking machine)} {hun|"machine"} {fi| "think"}</span>​ ​ <span class="tlt">{★ | "kill" (die cause)} {di|"cause"} {ta|"die"}</span>​ ​ <span class="tlt">{★ | "mother" (female parent)} {sun|"parent"} {fun | "female"}</span>​  ​ <span class="tlt">{★ |"fruit/vegetable/any edible plant"(plant food)} {min|"food"} {tun |"plant"}</span>​  ​ <span class="tlt">{★ |"bright/hot"(sun like)} {ma|"like/way/as"} {kin |"sun"}</span></p>
        <p>Well done. The translations given are not absolute, and the meaning of a compound is always relative to the context it is used in! Thus, <span class="tlt">{min|"food"} {tun|"plant"}</span> could easily be "food for plants" too!</p>
        <h3>More complex compounds</h3>
        <p>When you compound more than two words together, there is a default grouping that they follow. So, a <span class="tlt">{pun|"creature"} {be| "small"} {lin| "house"}</span>, is a <b>small house-creature,</b> - a small creature that might live in a house-  not a <b>small-house creature</b>, a creature that might have a small house. </p>
        <p>To regroup parts of a compound, we use the particle <span class="tlt">{'o| "of"}</span>. Thus, to say "small-house creature, we say <span class="tlt">{pun|"machine"} {'o| "think"} {be|small} {lin|house}</span> : creature of small house.</p>
        <p>Now it's your turn! Try to make compounds for the following English lexemes:</p>
        <p><span class="tlt">{★ father | sungun} {[hint]|a father is a male parent}</span>​  ​
        <span class="tlt">{★ doctor | sadun} {[hint]|a doctor is a person who deals with health}</span>
        <span class="tlt">{★ meat | minban} {[hint]|meat is flesh that we eat}</span>​  ​
        <span class="tlt">{★ rain | ginpin} {[hint]|rain is water that comes from the sky}</span>​  ​</p>
        <p>Well done.</p>
